# Data Analyst Portfolio :books:
Here are the 9 projects carried out in my Data Analyst training at OpenClassrooms.

# Presentation :scroll:

9 projects carried out, simulating real problems professionals will be presented:
- Sales analysis for an e-commerce
- Creation and use of a real estate database
- Realization of an international health study
- Optimize the management and analyze the sales of a shop
- Analyze the sales of a bookstore
- Analyze the F/M mix at work
- Study on drinking water internationally
- International market research
- Creation of an automated counterfeit detection program

All these projects are written in French.

*The projects presented serve to illustrate my progress during my studies, the last projects therefore representing the minimum level acquired since I obtained my degree as a Data Analyst.*

# How it work? :thinking:

Projects made in Python are accessible in HTML format with TOC or in IPNYB format.
The other projects will be accessible by using the tools that made them possible, or likely to read them.

A description of each project will be given in a **Scenario.pdf** file.

All the data necessary for the realization of the project will be placed in a sub-folder named **Data**.

Some notebooks and/or Data folder will be available in *.zip* format due to their large size.
