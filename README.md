# Data Analyst Portfolio :books:
Here are the 9 projects carried out in my Data Analyst training at OpenClassrooms.

To contact me:
```Python
print((pd.DataFrame([{"email":[108, 97, 114, 111, 115, 97, 102, 114, 101, 100, 101, 114, 105, 99, 64, 103, 109, 97, 105, 108, 46, 99, 111, 109]}])
 .assign(email=lambda d: d.email.apply(lambda l: "".join([chr(c) for c in l])))
).email)
```

You can download my [Portfolio_presentation](https://github.com/FredLaRosa/Portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio%20Data%20Analyst.pdf) and my [CV](https://github.com/FredLaRosa/Portfolio/blob/main/CV%20-%20Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20La%20Rosa%20-%20Data%20Scientist.pdf), both in .pdf format by clicking on their name.

A web application for the last project has been produced as a bonus, it is accessible by clicking on the badge below:

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/FredLaRosa/Streamlit_Project_1/main/Streamlit_app.py)

or on the repository of the [Streamlit_project_1](https://github.com/FredLaRosa/Streamlit_Project_1).

All these projects are written in French.

*The projects presented serve to illustrate my progress during my studies, the last projects therefore representing the minimum level acquired since I obtained my degree as a Data Analyst.*

# How it work? :thinking:

Projects made in Python are accessible in HTML format with TOC or in IPNYB format.
The other projects will be accessible by using the tools that made them possible, or likely to read them.

A description of each project will be given in a **Scenario.pdf** file.

All the data necessary for the realization of the project will be placed in a sub-folder named **Data**.

Some notebooks and/or Data folder will be available in *.zip* format due to their large size.

- Python
